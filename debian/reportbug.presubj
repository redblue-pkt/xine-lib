Reporting Bugs on libxine - general remarks
===========================================

As you can see on http://bugs.debian.org/src:xine-lib, the list of
bugs against xine is rather long. Please help the maintainer by
ensuring that your bugreport contains all pieces of infromation to
reproduce and check if the bug has been fixed.

Reporting bugs for unsupported file formats
===========================================

If you report a bug that a specific file cannot be played, please make
sure that you include a link to the file so the maintainers can try
them. If you cannot (easily) point to that file, please check
http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/ if you find a similar file with the same
problem. In any case, please start xine with the parameter
--bug-report. (If you are using gxine, please install the package
xine-ui instead. If you can only reproduce the bug with gxine but not
with xine-ui, then file the bug against gxine)

Report bugs for xine crashes
============================

If you report a bug that applications linked against libxine2
(xine-ui, gxine, amarok, totem, etc) segfault, please install the
packages 'xine-ui' and 'libxine2-dbg', and try to reproduce it with
this command:

> ulimit -c unlimited ; /usr/bin/xine --bug-report <mrl>

If you can reproduce the bug, then run gdb to get a backtrace:

> gdb /usr/bin/xine core.*

At the gdb prompt, please issue these commands:

# backtrace
# thread apply all backtrace full
# quit

Make sure to attach both files BUG-REPORT.TXT and the resulting
backtrace from gdb. Both are necessary to understand where and how the
segfault occured.

Thanks for your collaboration.
