        Update libcaca check to use the pkg-config file shipped with libcaca
        0.99, and change --disable-caca to --without-caca (to conform with
        other external libraries).
        Remove reference to removed caca.m4 (libcaca 0.99 will use

  * Dropping Conflicts on sinek and xine-ui (<< 0.9.10) (all only woody)

  * removing doc/faq/faq.html doc/faq/faq.txt doc/hackersguide/hackersguide.html
    on clean, missed by build system
  * include some targets to build 'orig' tarballs from the current branch.
    This mainly for my convinience for bootstrapping cvs versions of xine and

    order to minimize divergence

xine-lib (1.1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * build against external liba52
  * Bug fix: "libxine1: Please use the Debian ffmpeg version", thanks to
    Josselin Mouette. Please note that the ffmpeg version used has WMV3
    support. Unfortunately, this version of xine cannot use that support
    yet. This is 1.1.3 stuff. (Closes: #367095).

    libvcdinfo makes the segfault go away.
  * install a note for reportbug users

  * [sparc] Upstream fixed '--enable-vis'. So if compiling with vis, we are
    using -mcpu=v9. This creates binaries, which probably segfault on 'true'
    sparc32, but these poor old machines are not going to have much fun with

  * Use external libmad, acknowledging NMU (Closes: #336437)
  * enable support for libxvmc1, now that we have xorg in debian
    (Closes: #281572)
  * Conflict/Replaces obsolete package 'xine' (Closes: #300852)
  * Incorporated Darren's changes into a new maintainer upload.
  * medium urgency, although security fixes a lot of other functionality
    changes
  * Some more fixages to inline usage in internal copy of ffmpeg, continuing
    the patch from Darren Salt.
  * Verified that this upload fixes build on mips, and other build failiures
    look pretty similar. Therefore (Closes: #354436)
  * Verified that /usr/share/doc/libxine1/faq/faq.{html,txt} is now installed
    correctly (Closes: #369658)
  * fix gnome-vfs plugin to allow play back of http URLs again. Patch from
    upstream CVS, thank you for pointing this out, Sam Morris (Closes: #369974)

  [ Darren Salt ]

   * SECURITY FIXES (closes: #369876):
    - Possible buffer overflow in the AVI demuxer, caused by
      specially-crafted files or streams;
    - Possible buffer overflow in the HTTP header-fetching code.
      (CVE-2006-2802)

  * Tidy up the FAQ list and README installation to quieten dh_install.
  * Re-update the FSF address in debian/copyright. It got lost in 1.1.1-1.
  * Add build-dep alternatives for those of us who do backports to sarge.
  * Tidy up the package descriptions a little.
  * Bump shlibs to >= 1.1.0 due to new functions. (Closes: #358429, #368247)
  * Empty config file no longer prevents the config from being saved.
    (Fixed in upstream 1.1.1) (Closes: #320164)
  * Pulled in some patches from CVS:
    - the above security fixes;
    - fix ALSA resume-from-suspend;
    - fix incorrect size calculation in interlaced Matroska demuxing;
    - various uninitialised variables, some of which should be non-zero;
    - HTTP MRLs requiring authentication would only work when using a proxy;
    - fix possibly-broken locale handling in the SMB input plugin;
    - avoid problems where the ffmpeg audio decoder can't find a codec;
    - avoid a couple of compiler warnings (libavutil);
    - fix up some typecasting in the win32 codec interface;
    - avoid problems with negative sizes (general demuxing);
    - some plugin cache reading code should also be used on ia64;
    - fix a couple of printf warnings on 64-bit;
    - add some locking around playback speed change code;
    - incorrect default CPU acceleration setting on powerpc;
    - fix crash at startup if VO deinterlacing is enabled, onefield_xv is
      selected and the image format is YV12;
    - avoid possible segfault with 1x1 PNGs when handled by the ffmpeg plugin;
    - wrong names used for libX11 and libXv in the health check code (we now
      detect the correct names at build time);
    - add a missing -I to src/libffmpeg/libavcodec/sparc/Makefile.am (should
      fix an FTBFS on sparc);
    - alter configure.ac to avoid FTBFS when configure is regenerated with
      autoconf 2.59c or later.
  * Add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.
  * Fix usage of inlined functions in libffmpeg before they're defined. This is
    not implemented for all architectures in gcc 4.0.x and was causing FTBFS.
  * Kill some pointer<->int casting warnings on 64-bit architectures. (Taken
    from CVS HEAD)

xine-lib (1.0.1-1.3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Non-maintainer upload.

  * Backport patch from 1.0.2 that fixes hard hang-ups when a plugin listed in
    ~/.xine/catalog.cache becomes unloadable (closes: #328454). Plugins can
    become unloadable if DT_NEEDED libraries get uninstalled, which is
    possible because the package lists many of these libraries in the
    Recommends or Suggests fields only. With this fix, amarok should not
    freeze with the XINE engine anymore (closes: #327203), and totem either
    (closes: #328265).

    Patch included in debian/patches/fix-hangs-at-load-time.diff, but since
    there's no patch applying code in debian/rules, it's present in the
    .diff.gz as well.

  * Fix the script that invokes dpkg-shlibdeps to split dependencies among
    Depends, Recommends, and Suggests: it generated empty fields if one of the
    expected plugins was not actually available. (Closes: #328184)

    This means that now the package now suggests libgnomevfs2-0 (closes:
    #326935) and libflac7 (closes: #328168). Submitters may wish to reopen if
    they want a discussion with the maintainer about the need of these being
    strong Depends instead of Suggests.

  * xineplug_flac.so now links against libflac7 instead of libflac6, which
    closes: #325960 (the FLAC transition bug).

xine-lib (1.0.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Medium-urgency upload for RC bugfixes.
  * Multiple fixes for compatibility with gcc 4.0 strictness
    (closes: #288189, #318838)
  * This rebuild also gets rid of the dependency on libslang1
    (closes: #315986); it only trades it for libslang2 unfortunately,
    since libcaca is a static lib.
  * Build-Depend on libaa1-dev instead of the removed aalib1-dev
    (closes: #320317).
  * Build-Depend on libxinerama-dev instead of on xlibs-static-dev,
    which no longer provides this lib; it should be rolled back into
    xlibs-dev as a dependency eventually, but build-depending on it
    directly is sensible anyway.
  * Disentangle xine from libraries it doesn't actually use directly, so
    that the dependency tree is less brittle and requires fewer rebuilds
    in the future (e.g., it currently has a dependency on libstdc++5
    that it shouldn't need at all); this is doubly important since some
    plugins aren't mentioned at all in the dependencies, and so can be
    left unusable by library changes:
    - relibtoolize the package to use the Debian version of libtool,
      with support for pruning indirect dependencies from the linker
      commandline
    - as part of the above, add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to configure.ac to
      avoid any need for autotools build-dependencies
    - hard-code -lmodplug, -lartsc, and -lgnomevfs-2, because pkg-config,
      artsc-config, etc. spit out lib dependencies that are spurious on
      GNU/* systems.
