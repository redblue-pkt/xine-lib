xine-vdpau README:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, you want to give it a try, but wonder which steps are required.
Ok, so here it is:

1) get the sources:
svn co svn://jusst.de/xine-vdpau

2) compile the sources:
cd xine-vdpau
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install (as root)
    **(make sure that no other xine-lib installation will conflict with this one)

3) edit your xine configuration
nano $HOME/.xine/config (if it does not exist, first run "xine --no-logo" then quit.
search for "engine.buffers.video_num_frames" and set it to 22

4) running the beast:
xine --no-logo --verbose /path/to/a/working/sample
    ** the --no-logo will tell xine to not play its crappy mpv logo (which, atm, doesn't work with vdpau_mpeg12)
    ** --verbose will print some usefull things in your console (in case of problems, that are very likely to happen,
        the developers will ask you to give this output, at least)
    ** You can find working h264 samples at http://hftom.free.fr/video_samples/
    ** MKV or MOV WON'T WORK, at that moment. (we are concentrating on TS streams, but yes, it will work in the future)
    ** most mpeg2 should work, if you have a non working one, please provide a sample.

5) update your svn copy quite often

6) don't blame us if it crashes, burn you gpu (unlikely:) or anything else.

FAQ:

Q:
  Why my file plays fine with mplayer-vdpau and not with xine-vdpau?
A:
  We are not using the nvidia's libavcodec patch.
  We are writing decoders from scratch.
  So don't expect them to be as mature as ffmpeg ones. Not yet.

Q:
  Why mpeg2 doesn't use less cpu than software decoder?
A:
  Because at that moment it does a lot of memcpy. This will be fixed soon, but that's not
  a priority. Stability is our focus.

Q:
  Is deinterlacing working?
A:
  Yes. It's already quite good (doing 50i->50p), but could even be better in the future.

Q:
  How do i get it working with VDR, Kaffeine, whatever.
A:
  Ask VDR, Kaffeine, whatever developers.
    (Note: for kaffeine you are lucky, i'm going to tell you the tip.
     Build kaffeine like that: ./configure --without-xcb && make && make install)

Q:
  How can i contact you?
A:
  IRC: #xine-vdpau on freenode
  MAIL: http://lists.kafic.ba/mailman/listinfo/xine-vdpau
  Eventually, nvnews.
