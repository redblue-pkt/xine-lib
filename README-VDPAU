FAQ:

Q:
  Why my file plays fine with mplayer-vdpau and not with xine-vdpau?
A:
  We are not using the nvidia's libavcodec patch.
  We are writing decoders from scratch.
  So don't expect them to be as mature as ffmpeg ones. Not yet.

Q:
  Why mpeg2 doesn't use less cpu than software decoder?
A:
  Because at that moment it does a lot of memcpy. This will be fixed soon, but that's not
  a priority. Stability is our focus.

Q:
  Is deinterlacing working?
A:
  Yes. It's already quite good (doing 50i->50p), but could even be better in the future.

Q:
  How do i get it working with VDR, Kaffeine, whatever.
A:
  Ask VDR, Kaffeine, whatever developers.
    (Note: for kaffeine you are lucky, i'm going to tell you the tip.
     Build kaffeine like that: ./configure --without-xcb && make && make install)

Q:
  How can i contact you?
A:
  IRC: #xine-vdpau on freenode
  MAIL: http://lists.kafic.ba/mailman/listinfo/xine-vdpau
  Eventually, nvnews.

Q:
  What information do I need if there's a problem?
A:
  Run 'xine --verbose /path/to/a/working/sample' (or equivalent for your
  chosen front end). You will probably be asked for this anyway, so it
  helps to have it handy.
