       free multimedia


xine-lib is a free multimedia engine, released under the GNU GPL. See COPYING
for details.


IMPORTANT:

If you're reading this and you maintain an application which uses xine-lib
1.1, you should be considering moving to xine-lib 1.2. You may need to
adapt your software a bit: various deprecated/obsolete interfaces, present
in 1.1, have gone in 1.2.

The 1.1 series is, as of early 2012, receiving bug fixes only. It is
regarded as deprecated, and is likely to become obsolete and (mostly)
unmaintained in 2013, or possibly a little sooner.


see the doc/ directory for more information about xine-lib. You will find
various README files, FAQ and developer documentation (xine hacker's guide)
there. Developers will find additional documentation for xine interfaces
in the form of header file comments in the xine sources (for example the
xine-lib API is documented in the include/xine.h header file).

Individual frontends (e.g. xine-ui, gxine, totem, ...) may provide
additional documentation in their packages.

For more information on xine features (supported multimedia formats etc.)
see the xine homepage, located at http://www.xine-project.org/

The xine-lib XML parser (src/xine-utils/xmlparser.[ch] and
src/xine-utils/xmllexer.[ch]) is released under the GNU LGPL, see COPYING.LIB
for details.
