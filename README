			 !! IMPORTANT NOTE !!

LIBTOOL version:
	you should have libtool >= 1.4 installed to compile xine-lib. You 
can grab the source tarball from an official GNU ftp server if there is no 
binary package available for your distro.

Also, You should probably apply the patch (automake.diff) to automake (will
be unnecessary in futur automake release).
