external projects used in libxine and its plugins
=================================================

This list is provided to give credit to the external project maintainers
that their work is used in xine.

It is also useful to track the versioning and see, which copy of an
external lib needs updating and who (if anyone) is usually doing these
updates (the word 'maintainer' is intentionally avoided here).

[GPL] this is the latest GPL compatible version of FAAD2. later cvs
  snapshots have added an advertisement clause so we cannot update until
  the situation gets fixed.


[*] common question: lastest version of libmpeg2 is 0.3.1, why don't
you update?

  the answer is not so simple. 

  quoting libmpeg2.sf.net: "The old API [0.2.x] was not flexible enough for
  most users, as a result various projects (xine, mplayer etc...) ended up
  rewriting their own versions of decode.c."

  this is indeed true: in order to support a lot of dvd features, menus with
  still frames, closed caption decoding and better buffer management for
  xine it was needed to patch our libmpeg2 copy. of course we should always
  try not to "fork" external projects, but in the libmpeg2/xine case it is
  easy to see (from CVS logs) how long did it took to reach the stability
  point we have now.

  so, while targeting a stable libxine release, there is no hurry in
  updating libmpeg2 and this is not the trivial task as it might sound.

  note that we have also backported some fixes/improvements from libmpeg2
  cvs (eg. motion vector clipping for broken streams). if you need any
  specific change or fix feel free to send us a patch or discuss the issue
  at xine-devel.

  update plan for libmpeg2: we should leave our patched libmpeg2 for 
  hardware accelerated decoding (xvmc) only and use "libmpeg2new" (containing 
  updated libmpeg2) for software decoding.


[o] These libraries are not well maintained and subsetted from the
    packages where they come from. The external versions of libcdio
    and libvcdinfo are preferred. You also get regression tests and
    CD/VCD diagnostic tools.
