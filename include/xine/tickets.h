/*
 * xine thread tickets.
 * This is similar to a rw lock in "prefer writers" mode.
 * - Shared recursive read lock: acquire () / release ()
 * - Recursive write lock:       revoke ()  / issue ()
 * plus there are a few special hacks.
 * - Low overhead temporary read unlock: renew ()
 *   (better than release () + acquire ()).
 *   Mutex less check ticket_revoked whether it is time to do so.
 *   Yes this may delay writers a bit due to multicore data cache
 *   sync issues (and your check interval, of course) but since
 *   writing is rare we accept that.
 *   Alternatively, register a revoke notify callback that stops
 *   waiting for something else.
 * - Read lock with priority over writers: "irrevocable"
 *   (use for known quick actions only).
 * - Top level uninterruptible write lock: "atomic".
 * Note that the write side is for engine internal use.
 * It now also supports turning an already held read into write
 * temporarily.

   * - If there is a pending rewire, ticket_revoked has the rewire flag set.
   * - A pending or incoming rewire revoke repels plain renewers, so they
   *   can advance to a code location more suitable for a rewire, then
   *   renew again with rewire flag set.
   * - Output layer get funcs return an emergency buffer/frame if engine is paused.
   *   Why the f**k didnt we allow NULL there??
   * - Decoder loops let the full thing go right before next iteration. */
