The contrib/ subdirectory for xine-lib contains the code for libraries
that are not developed by the xine project, but are rather imported
from other projects.

These libraries are imported either because they need to be patched to
fix bugs not yet fixed in any released version, to make it simpler for
the users to have the library installed, or because there's no proper
release done by that project.

This README file should explain how to upgrade the code present in the
contrib/ directory with new sources from the development project.

libxdg-basedir
--------------

The libxdg-basedir project is a (really) small library used to provide
the proper access to XDG directories as described by the XDG Base
Directory Specification (0.6 version).

The library can be found at
https://n.ethz.ch/student/nevillm/download/libxdg-basedir/ , and it's
imported in xine-lib as it's far from commonly found on distributions.
