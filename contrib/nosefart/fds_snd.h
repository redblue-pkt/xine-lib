** Revision 1.2  2003/12/05 15:55:01  f1rmb
** cleanup phase II. use xprintf when it's relevant, use xine_xmalloc when it's relevant too. Small other little fix (can't remember). Change few internal function prototype because it xine_t pointer need to be used if some xine's internal sections. NOTE: libdvd{nav,read} is still too noisy, i will take a look to made it quit, without invasive changes. To be continued...
