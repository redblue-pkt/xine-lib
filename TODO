known bugs
==========

- frame allocation problem with h264 streams using > 15 reference frames
- our faad2 has problems with 5.1 streams. faad2 cvs is GPL incompatible.
- dvdnav time search function does not use the time table, but interpolates
  only cell times
- crash with RV10 streams


requested/planned features
==========================

- advanced audio processors
- audio normalization
- crossfading
- high quality overlay blending / OSD
  (eg. Jason Tackaberry's advanced BGRA blend plugin)
- synchronized playback between multiple machines
- high quality sound resampling (use libsamplerate / secret rabbit code)
- "synchroneous post plugins" (post plugins behind the output fifo)
- move pvr and v4l_adjust_realtime_speed routines to xine engine
  so it can be used by any input plugin.


the following text is kept from pre-1.0 times - we must check what is still relevant
====================================================================================

optional
--------

- properly localize all user-visible strings
- sort out which messages should go to console and which to xine_log
- look over global structures and do some cleanup
- id3v2.3,v2.4 support
- "metainfo change" event
- double-check rate estimation in demux_mpeg/mpeg_block
- fix cook audio streaming
- better dvd error messages
- fix streaming of small files (e.g. http) 

- rtp / rtsp support:

  - input_rtp
  - rtsp support (currently only real's rtsp derivate is implemented)
  - isma/apple streaming server support (mpeg4ip.sf.net)
  - find out what all those people requesting rtp/multicast/... support
    really want and how to implement it :)
  - videolan streaming server support
  - helix streaming server support

- detect broken savage drivers in health check, disable Xv in that case
- directfb video output plugin
- reduce memory footprint (e.g. variable fifo buffer sizes...)
- opengl video output plugin (matthias, sopra at stuttgart university)
- irix audio output plugin (matthias)

beyond 1.0
----------

- use the safe string functions from xine_buffer.h in xine's own code
- rework the clock system, introducing clock and metronom speed settings
- allow more frame formats, automatic post plugin insertion for conversion
- frame-level seeking
- experiment with splint for code verification

Open Tasks
==========

- port to other OS (Net/OpenBSD, hurd ...?)
- MicroDVD input plugin
- video output synced to vertical blank
  preferably without requiring
  root privileges (XSync extension? MAS?)
- resolve issues with ffmpeg's live http streaming server
- videolan streaming support
- MAS support (http://www.mediaapplicationserver.net)
- nonlinear video editing and compositing frontend (michael) => enix
- stream format conversion frontend => enix
- Multiple DVD Subtitles displayed at the same time 
- Move read cache code from libdvdnav into input_dvd.c
- Support DVD "Trick" modes. Super Fast forward/reverse
- detect raw ac3/a52 in MPEG Program streams.
- detect raw ac3/a52 in MPEG Transport streams that lack PAT/PMT tables.
- handle MPEG PES/PS streams with PES_packet_length = 0

xine's future
=============

- implement lots of audio and video processing filters as post plugins, e.g.
  - scaling
  - colorspace conversion
  - deinterlacing (already done)
  - audio resampling
  - compressor
  ...

  extend public api so post plugins are instantiated automatically when
  needed, but keep explicit post plugin rewiring functions for advanced
  video processing frontends 

- see what kind of cooperation can be set up with other media player projects
  - mike will look into moving xine's decoder api closer to the one
    ffmpeg uses
  - check out other media players
  - output, demuxer plugins
