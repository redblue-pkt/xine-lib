     a unix video player



about xine:
-----------

xine is a free gpl-licensed video player for unix-like systems.
We support mpeg-2 and mpeg-1 system (audio + video multiplexed) streams,
mpg audio files and AVI files (using win32 codec dlls).

xine plays the video and audio data of the stream and synchronizes
the playback of both. Depending on the properties of the stream,
playback will need more or less processor power, full frame rate
for mpeg-2 has been seen on a 400 MHz P II system.

xine can play Video CDs, SVCDs and DVDs directly. Unfortunately the legal
status of encrypted/locked DVD playback is uncertain in some countries
so we cannot include any DVD unlock/decrypt code with xine. To play back
such DVDs you'll need external programs or something like a
xine_dvd_plugin that can handle DVD authentification/descrambling.

xine tries to be straightforward and effective. ...no bells and
whistles are being developed at this time ;-) first we want to achieve
good playback of video.


supported platforms / requirements:
----------------------------------

- xine needs a locally attached graphics device and monitor (playback over
  x is not supported at the moment and will probably never be really useful
  because of the enormous bandwidth of decoded video streams).
- xine needs either MIT-SHM (The MIT Shared Memory Extension), which is
  supported in XFree86 for quite some time (3.3.x will be fine),
  or X-Video Extension (Xv) which is faster and supports fullscreen
  operation but is only provided by some XFree86 4.x drivers.
  nVidia chips and Matrox G200 and G400 are known to work.
- if you can't get Xv to run on your platform you should use 16bpp 
  colordepth for speed. Xv seems to work nicely for 16 and 24bpp.
- if you have a mga 200 / 400 graphics adaptor you can optionally
  use the sybcfb/teletux video ouput driver. See README.syncfb for 
  details.
- you need a sound driver that is realtime capable (not all
  OSS/ALSA drivers support that feature) or ESD

xine has so far been sucessfully used on the following systems:

- Linux on a Pentium III 667
  using XFree86 4.01 on a nVidia Riva TNT 2
- Linux on a Pentium II 400
  using XFree86 3.3.6, 4.0, 4.01 and 4.02 on a nVidia Riva TNT
- FreeBSD 4.1-Release on a Celeron 400
  using XFree86 3.3.6 and 4.0.1 on a Matrox G400
- Linux on a Pentium 120 (no MMX)
  using XFree86 3.3.5 on a Trident 9660
- Linux on an AMD K6-266
  using XFree86 3.3.5 on a ATI AIW M64-8Mb PCI
- Linux on an AMD K6-III 450
  using XFree86 3.3.6 on a ATI RageII 8MB
- Linux on a Celeron 633
  using XFree86 4.0.1 on a ATI AIW Rage128-16MB
- Linux on a Amd K7@550
  using Xfree 4.0.1 on a Ati Rage 128 16 Mb 
  (Xv is working on this configuration with drivers from GATOS project)
- Linux on a Celeron 667
  using XFree86 4.0.2 on a Riva TNT 16Mb 
  (Xv is working on this configuration with closed-sources drivers
  version 0.9.5 from NVidia).
- Linux on a Amd K6-2@475
  using XFree86 4.1.0 on a 3dfx voodoo3 2000 PCI 16Mb 
  (Xv is working on this configuration)
- Solaris 8 on Intel
  using Xsun on a ATI Xpert@Work & Xpert98 (3D RAGE PRO)
  see README.solaris for more infomation

non-intel platforms:
- Solaris 8 on SPARC
  using Xsun on a Creator-3D framebuffer
  see README.solaris for more infomation

usage:
------

You can start xine without any command line parameters or you can 
specify one or more input streams directly. Xine tries to detect wheter 
it can use the Xv extension and will fall back to XShm, but that 
detection might fail.
If you don't see any video, first check your X11 drivers (for example
only the binary drivers from nVidia have Xv support for their chips).
If you can't get Xv to work, use the "-s" option and xine will be
forced to use Xshm.
If you get very sloppy video ouput your sound driver may not be
realtime capable. Try to use ALSA instead or, if you're already using
ALSA you might want to give OSS a try.
If you want to send the sound over a network with ESD, set the ESPEAKER
environment variable before starting xine.

The input stream can be a filename or something we call 
"MediaResourceLocator" MRL, which looks similar to a URL. First you
specify an input source which is followed by "://" and an input-source
specific identifier. What input sources you can use depends on the
input plugins you have (for plain files you can omit the input-source
identifier). Try 

$ xine --help

to get the complete usage.

Unfortunately the gui does not yet support the MRL concept to any
great extend, so to use any other input source than plain files you'll
have to use the command line at the moment. That will change soon :-)

Example usage:

$ xine

$ xine /path/foo.vob

$ xine -s /foo/test.mpg

xine supports the xdnd protocol (Version 3) so if you have a file browser 
application supporting that protocol (e.g. gmc) you can drop video files
on xine for playback.

Playing track 3 from a VCD:

$ xine vcd://3

Example for direct DVD access:

$ xine dvd://VTS_01_1.VOB

Keyboard shortcuts:
-------------------

Key           action

RETURN        play
F             toggle fullscreen mode
Q             quit
0             jump start of current stream
1-9           jump to 10-90% of current stream
SPACE         pause
PgUp/Prior    jump to previous playlist entry
PgDown/Next   jump to next playlist entry
A             toggle aspect ratio (AUTO/16:9/4:3/DVB)
Ctrl          show/hide mouse cursor

more to come.

Click right on the video window to toggle panel visibility.

selecting audio channels:
-------------------------

Supply the -a option to select the desired audio track:

xine -a 3 test.mpg

plays the third mpg audio track (and the video, of course).

For mpeg-1, only mpeg audio (layer 1, 2 and 3) is supported.

Mpeg-2 streams can have different types of audio streams, though.
Xine supports ac3 (dolby digital), mpeg and LPCM sound. These
are mapped to the following tracks:

Track    selected audio stream

 0- 7    ac3 stream 0-7
 8-15    mpg audio stream 0-7
16-23    pcm audio stram 0-7

example: to play pcm stream 0 use

xine -a 16 file.vob

selecting subtitles:
--------------------

Subtitles are embedded in different tracks like audio. In general,
track 0 is the default language subtitle. Use the -u option to 
select the desired subtitle track:

xine -u 0 test.vob

displays the subtitles from stream 0.

controlling xine via CORBA:
---------------------------

Xine implements a CORBA server interface to enable remote control and
scripting. For this, you need ORBit which should already be installed if
you are using GNOME. Otherwise you can get it from

  http://orbit-resource.sourceforge.net/

Any version of ORBit >= 0.4.0 should work fine.

To enable the CORBA interface, you need to supply the "--enable-corba"
argument to the ./configure script and recompile xine.

The xine server interface definition can be found in "corba/xine.idl" which
gets installed to "/usr/share/idl/xine.idl" by default.

To communicate with xine via CORBA, you need to get its IOR (Interoperable
Object Reference). Upon startup, xine writes it to the file ~/.xine.ior
where you can read it from. If the ORBit name service is running, xine
also registers itself there under the name "Xine". Unfortunately, the
ORBit name server is usually not activated by default. You have to run
it manually like this:

  orbit-name-server >/tmp/name-service-ior &

See the ORBit docs for more information.

Two example client programs are provided:
  1. "xine-remote" is an example client written in C which can be used to
     send play/stop/pause commands to a running instance of xine
  2. "example.py" is a small Python script that demonstrates how to easily
     control xine from a scripting language

using LIRC with xine:
---------------------

Xine can be remotly controlled with by IR. For this, you should have
LIRC installed (http://www.lirc.org), you should get latest CVS snapshot
if you're running latest Linux kernels (2.2 or 2.4 series). 

You should add some entries in your ~/.lircrc, like this:
begin
	remote = SAMSUNG
	button = Button_Play
	prog   = xine
	repeat = 0
	config = PLAY
end
begin
	remote = SAMSUNG
	button = Button_Src
	prog   = xine
	repeat = 0
	config = DVD
end
begin
	remote = SAMSUNG
	button = Button_1
	prog   = xine
	repeat = 0
	config = 10%
end
...

All valids strings orders are:

 - for quiting:
      quit
 - for set the current position in current stream playback:
      0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% 
 - for play or stop:
      play
 - for pausing:
      pause
 - for eject:
      eject
 - for next/previous MRL in the playlist:
      next, prev
 - for next/previous audio track selection:
      audio+, audio-
 - for next/previous sub-title selection:
      spu+, spu-
 - to get the playlist from a DVD/VCD:
      dvd, vcd
 - to hide/show the GUI, the output video window:
      hidegui, hideoutput
 - to toggle the output video window<->fullscreen
      fullscr

All of orders are not case sensitive.

used software:
--------------

xine uses software from the following free software projects:

- libac3 by Aaron Holtzman
- libmpeg2 by Aaron Holtzman
- libmpg123 of the mpg123 project by Michael Hipp
  (see http://www.mpg123.de/)

...without these great pieces of software xine would of course not
be where it is now.

also many thanks to the Linux Video and DVD Project "LiViD"
(http://www.linuxvideo.org/), where the original ideas for the xine
video player came from.
