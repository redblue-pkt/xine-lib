.SH NAME
xine\-config - script to get information about the installed version of libxine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xine\-config
[\-\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fP] [\-\-exec\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fP] [\-\-version]

[\-\-plugindir] [\-\-datadir] [\-\-scriptdir] [\-\-localedir]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIxine\-config\fP is a tool that is used to determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile
and link programs that use \fIlibxine\fP. It can also be used to determine
the directories where \fIlibxine\fP expects plugins and skins.
Finally, it's also used internally
by the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf that are included with \fIxine-lib\fP.
.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIxine\-config\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fIlibxine\fP on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link \fIlibxine\fP to a program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags
.TQ 8
.B  \-\-objcflags
Print the compiler flags (for C and Objective C, respectively) that are
necessary to compile a program that uses \fIlibxine\fP.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-bindir
.TQ 8
.B  \-\-plugindir
.TQ 8
.B  \-\-datadir
.TQ 8
.B  \-\-scriptdir
.TQ 8
.B  \-\-localedir
Print the directory where, respectively, \fIlibxine\fP binaries, plugins,
data files, scripts and locale data are stored/expected.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that \fIxine-lib\fP
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-exec\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that
\fIxine-lib\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
