xine fails when allocating images
---------------------------------

Make sure you have enough shared memory enabled. This is very
limited by default.

Edit your /etc/sysctl.conf:

kern.ipc.shmmax=67108864
kern.ipc.shmall=32768


mtrr on freebsd
---------------

setting up the caching behaviour of the memory on the graphics board.

what is being done with the mtrr support on linux is to set the caching
type of the memory of the graphics board to 'write-combine' mode.
that way the performance of big writes into this memory should be faster.

it seems that the same can be achieved on freebsd by executing:

  memcontrol set -b <base-address> -l <length> write-combine

for example on my system i executed:

  memcontrol set -n 0xd8000000 -l 0x02000000 write-combine

i got the base-adress by executing 'startx' and looking at the output.

it seems to be dangerous to change the cache setting of the graphics memory
while xfree is running - at least i managed to have my system freeze that
way. so better do it on the commandline.

this tip is still subject of research, so it might be incorrect - please
report any further information on this topic to the xine-user list.
please also report success or non-success on xine-user if you have the time.


playing video cd on freebsd
---------------------------

currently (because of issues with the freebsd kernel) xine can only
play video cd from atapi cdrom drives. not for scsi drives!

currently (Jan 2001), FreeBSD-stable (and thus the current releases also)
needs a patch to the kernel sources to make video cd work (please check
the freebsd documentation if you are unsure on how to build a custom
kernel with this patch included).

the file you have to patch is /sys/dev/ata/atapi-cd.c:

--- atapi-cd.c  Sun Jan 21 14:47:13 2001

v4l on freebsd
--------------

For building v4l plugins you will need install v4l_compat package.
