This directory contains the xine hacker's guide.


The xine hacker's guide is written in docbook/sgml 4.1.
You can learn more about docbook at

http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/documentation/reference/html/docbook.html


To use docbook - for example to compile the sgml files into html - you
will need the DocBook DTD itself as well as the following tools: dsssl
(Modular DocBook Stylesheets), jade (SGML parser toolkit and dsssl
engine) and sp (toolkit for sgml parsing), or replacements for those.

If you want to generate TeX output (needed for postscript or pdf
generation) you will also need jadetex (backend for TeX) and an
installed TeX system (for example teTeX).
