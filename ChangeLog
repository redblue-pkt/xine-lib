	before we go for the next big architecture update that will
	be in the 0.3.x series

	
  0.2.3
	- included patches by Alan Cox:
	  net_plugin, bug fixes (i.e. VCD ...)
	- xshm video output module fixed for bpp>16
	  (but don't use that for speed reasons!)
	- new iDCT_mmx code from walken 
	  => picture quality massively improved :))
	- FAQ update
	- speed improvements due to new compiler switches
	- minor Makefile fixes for FreeBSD ports
